# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This directory contains my submission to the Coursera course [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-002/).

There are four files:

- an R script "run_analysis.R"
- Codebook.md which describes the data produced by that script
- this README.md
- the output file tidy.csv (because I could not upload it to Coursera)

## Input data

You will need the input data and put it into the current working directory when running the script.

The script will then output the "tidy dataset" in a file called "tidy.csv".


> The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available [at the site where the data was obtained.](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
